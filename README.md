This is header that provides class Effect wich has one function you need to
implement in your child class
basically in your implementation you use EFFECT macros which take function and duration
in function please feel free to use PROGRESS macro which is must have in any animation
you can use DURATION too if you want it is the one you pass to the EFFECT

please do not use int for this class because PROGRESS macro is not working with int
